# Task List App

This is a simple task list app that allows you to add and manage tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add tasks: You can add tasks to the list by entering them in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
- Mark tasks as done: You can mark tasks as done by clicking on them, which will toggle the "checked" class on the list item.
- Remove tasks: You can remove tasks from the list by clicking on the "✗" (delete) icon next to the task.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
4. Click on a task to mark it as done, or click on the "✗" icon to remove it from the list.
5. The app will automatically save the task list data to localStorage, so the tasks will persist even if you refresh the page or close the browser.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of three main parts:

1. **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the app, including the input box, list container, and event listeners for user interactions.

2. **CSS**: The `style.css` file contains the styles for the app, including the layout, fonts, and colors.

3. **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the app, including adding tasks, marking tasks as done, removing tasks, and saving/retrieving data from localStorage.
